GALasm

.pld is the GAL specification file. 
galasm creates several files, all are text files:
.chp - Generated ASCII art of the IC.
.fus - The fuse map. It contains a map of fuses for each pin. Here it is
       clear how much AND terms are allowed for each pin. The lines 
       match the JED map in the manual. 
.jed - This is the input file for the programmer. 
.pin - A list of pins and how the assembler sees them.

; is the comment character. All that follows on the line is ignored by 
the assembler.
Empty lines (whitespace only) are also ignored.

First line specifies the GAL; GAL22V10, GAL18V10, ...
Second line specifies the name of the configuration, to be saved in the 
GAL. Usually the same as the name of the pld file.

The third and fourth line declare the pin names. It is convenient to 
precede the third line and follow the fourth line with a comment line 
specifying the pin numbers for orientation.

The third line defines the side with pin 1, the fourth the upper half
of the pins. The last pin on the lower side is usually GND, The highest
pin is usually Vcc.

Pin names are separated by one or more spaces.

Example:

;1     2    3      4      5     6    7     8     9     10    11     12
M1   IORQ   WR     A0     A1    A2   A3    A4    A5    A6    A7     GND
WP   WLOAD WMIAD  WHIAD  DATCS  COM  STA  RAMWR  WIClk  RD  DlyDCS  VCC
;13  14    15     16     17     18    19    20    21    22  23      24

Pin names can be proceeded by a '/' to indicate their active state. This 
can simplify or complicate the output pin definitions. No '/' means high 
is active, low is in-active. The '/' reverses this. As both sides of the 
output pin definition also allows this reversal, the one in the 
declaration is optional.

The following lines define the output pins. The presence of a pin 
definition here makes the pin output. All other pins are inputs. This 
also have to match with the hardware capabilities of the pins.
An output pin definition can be preceeded with a '/', indicating the pin 
is active low.
A output pin definition can contain one or more AND terms. All elements
in the AND term are ANDed. If more than one AND term is used, they are
separated by an OR. The maximum number of AND terms is limited and varies
per pin and mode. Combinatorial mode contains just logic, registered mode
allows latching with a pin defined as clock (usually a fixed pin). 

Example (single AND term):
/WLOAD =  A7 * /A6 * /A5 *  A4 * /A3 * /A2 * /A1 * /A0 * /M1 * IORQ * WR  ; 090h write


The pin definitions can be followed by a line starting with 'DESCRIPTION'
all following lines are ignored by the assembler.

This usually contains an ASCII art of the pinout. This is more intuitive 
than the declaration where the second line is 'reversed'. But note it is
just comment.

A output pin definition can contain both input pins and (other) output 
pins. Just the pin name means active high and preceeded with a '/' means
active low.

As the active low specifier can be used in the declaration and in both 
sides of the definition, it can be very confusing. 
In the declaration it decouples the high level from 'active'.
